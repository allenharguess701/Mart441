### Work Flow
So like before I added onto the existing website and as before the secondary navigation bar listing the homework assignments has the new full memory game link.

I used four cards (Ace, 10, 5, 2). Debugging was a real pain in the backside as was the syntax of the code. Getting the variables to pass from page to page was a struggle. The video tutorials were a great help but I think a bit too simplistic for the task. I used a variable to track the number of good guesses and since there were only four total used it to trigger the end of the game and show the results page. 

Did I Mention I hate Java HATEEEEEEEEEE IT! lol, ;)
