### Work Flow
I completed this assignment simply by adding the Console_log_example.js file to my original HW-1 directory and made a simple edit to the interests.html page to incorporate the javascript file into the output of that page.

I tested the page in Chrome, and Firefox and saw only subtle differences is how the pages looked and no differences in how the console responded.

It took me around 30 minutes to complete this project with no real issues; although, I have had very little experience with Javascript and have not really ever used the console.
