### Work Flow
So like before i simply added onto the existing website adding in a secondary minor navigation bar listing the homework assignments. The game link is for this assignment.

I my intention is to pass two simple variables to control the changes in the document write based on what question the player is on and the option they have chosen. The variables passes are "question" & "option".

This has been a very challenging assignment. I honestly hate javascript and would prefer to use PHP with a database. I presented the first question and options but was unable to get the variables to pass to the subsequent pages. I tried various methods but none worked. Also I was not sure if I was to just present the question and options through javascript only or if I was pose to actually do a change to the document write based on the choice made.
