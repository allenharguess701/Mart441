### Work Flow
So I  did things a bit different from what I think was asked for. I did this to better illustrate
visually the responsive nature of breakpoints. What I did was split the sections up into pages that are listed on the top Navigation bar. Each link sends the user to a different page related to the topics of the sections.

I included multiple breakpoints for the major devices. The hero image is centered below the initial welcome blurp. I also included a fixed background image. Due to the nature of the background image I had an issue with virtually every decent color of text blending into the image and was unreadable. my solution was to use a text shadow combination to visually highlight the text in a subtle way.

I tested the page in Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox and saw only subtle differences is how the pages looked.

It took me around 6.5 hours to complete this project as It has been a while since I have coded anything other than WordPress related templates. nothing really responsive from scratch. Some of the source code I used from my own code library. I also did some research on various tutorials sites for both HTML and CSS.
