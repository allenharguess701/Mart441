### Work Flow
So like before i simply added onto the existing website adding in a secondary minor navigation bar listing the homework assignments. The game link is for this assignment.

I chose to pass two simple variables to control the changes in the document write based on what question the player is on and the option they have chosen. The variables passes are "question" & "option".

This has been a very challenging assignment. I honestly hate javascript and would prefer to use PHP with a database.
