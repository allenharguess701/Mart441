### Work Flow
So like before I added onto the existing website and as before the secondary navigation bar listing the homework assignments has the Picture Viewer link.

I added in several images from the online game World of Warcraft. Specifically the Battle for Azeroth Expansion. I had issues with the image url coming up scrambled. It had something to do with the \ causing an issue so I set the url into a different array.
