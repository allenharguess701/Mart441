      First, A little bit about me;<br><br>

      I was born on Hamilton Air Field, a small and now forgotten US Air Force Base in Marin country
      California in 1968. Born to Luther Harguess and Katherine House, along with two younger sisters
      Sheila and Rachel. I grew up in the Suisun-Fairfield area just outside Travis Air Force Base
      where my father was stationed for twenty years.<br><br>

      In 1980 the family moved to Fresno California where I lived up until January 2017. I moved here to
      Missoula to attend the university. I am married but separated and have five children; four girls
      and a boy. The oldest; Sebastian,  Has just graduated and is attending college. I have a duaghter;
      Lillian, attending her sinior year at Roosevelt High. My third, Autumn, is currently also attending
      roosevelt as a freshman. My two youngest; Zoe and Serenity are still in primary school.<br><br>

      I, like my father am an Air Force Veteran, having served nearly twenty years with the 144th Fighter
      Wing. My AFSC was that of a Non-Destructive Inspections Specialist. Through the military I was able
      to travel all over the world, meet and work with many great people, and visit some interesting places.<br><br>

      I have been a programmer and web-designer for a long time. I can program both front and backside
      applications. I feel that the Harguess.com network speaks for itself as far as the quality of work I’m
      capable of. I am also a graphic designer and a writer. I have been published twice. I write short stories,
      but mostly poetry. I’m currently working on my first novel.<br><br>

      I love growing things and always had a large, veggie garden and I’ve always had side projects I
      work on. as one is completed another one always seems to take its place. Prepping is also a big
      part of my life. Knowing how to live as my forefathers once did is very important to me. Along
      with that, Milsim is also a big hobby of mine. Airsoft is not just a sport it’s a way to train
      militarily, keep fit, and have loads of fun while doing it.<br><br>

      My Favorite author is a toss up between Richard Adams and Frank Herbert. Poet is also a toss up.
      Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allen Poe are tied for that one. Favorite movie is of course Star Wars.
      I listen to all kind of music. I have no favorite food as I love all foods. Color is green.<br><br>

      My favorite quote<br><br>

      “To the last, I grapple with thee; From Hell’s heart, I stab at thee; For hate’s sake, I spit my
      last breath at thee”<br><br>

      By Herman Melville<br>
      From Mody-Dick<br><br>

      Genealogy is also a pet project of mine. It all started in Middle school with an English homework.
      I’ve been doing it ever since. I have a large family tree on Ancestry.com and a whole site
      dedicated to the project. I’ve been avle to create a hard link to as far back as 1774 and a warm
      jello link back to 1554.<br><br>

      Currently I am a full time student at the University of Montana; a wonderful school, of which I
      am just about to graduate with a BFA in Media Arts. My intention is to get my masters degree and teach
      here at t he university.<br><br>
