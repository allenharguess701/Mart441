### Work Flow
This thing was sooooooo complex. trying to keep track of the data links between the index and scripts pages was daunting. it took forever to debug and was constantly breaking. sometimes because of a single misplaced charater.  

I did a larger storu line from homework four, but it's still short. i simply ran out of time to do any more. I had intended on doing a database connection to the character so that you could pick things up and add them to an inventory or use them from the inventor. also i was intending to do a combat system which I had already written for another program but it turns out the php code had depreciated. i wrote it several years ago.

I'm thinking i'm going to continue to develop this app. i'm thinking i can tag it onto a wordpress database that will allow users a safe secure login but with all the bells and whistles of wordpress and a database connection.
